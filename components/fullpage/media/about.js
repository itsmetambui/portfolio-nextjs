              I enjoy writing beautiful code, code that can be easily understood
              by future developers. With the help of Prettier, Eslint, Husky...,
              I can make sure my code meet those standards.

              I'm a TDD practitioner, I love that I can make changes without any

              I like shipping things. Whether it is a bug fix or a feature, I
              realized that every line of code is an opportunity to make a
              userâ€™s experience better. That will not be feasible without CI/CD.
